The 2025–2026 HVUT tax filing season is almost here and filing taxes in a rush shouldn’t slow down your trucking operations at all. One of the best ways to streamline your tax filing process is pre-filing form 2290. By prioritizing early filing, you can receive your IRS-stamped Schedule 1 faster than ever, hassle-free. In this guide, we'll explain why pre-filing matters and how you can easily pre-file your form 2290. 

What is pre-filing form 2290?
Pre-filing form 2290 simply means you are filing your Heavy Highway Vehicle Usage Tax (HVUT) ahead of the filing season and avoiding last-minute stress and delays during peak filing season. For the 2025-2026 tax period, pre-filing commences on May 1, 2025, and runs through June 30, 2025. This early filing option ensures you are all set for the year in advance and can focus on core operations and avoid potential penalties later on. Moreover, it’s also a ticket to earlier and faster acceptance of your e-filing once the IRS begins processing.

Pre-file and drive worry free into the new tax year! File form 2290 now!

Note: You can opt to pre-file your form 2290 during this period; however, the IRS will start processing tax returns and issuing form 2290 Schedule 1 on July 1, 2025.



When to pre-file form 2290?
The pre-filing period for the 2025-2026 tax year opens on May 1, 2025, and closes on June 30, 2025. During this time, you can submit your HVUT return in advance to avoid last-minute delays and penalties before the IRS officially starts processing form 2290 filings on July 1, 2025.
